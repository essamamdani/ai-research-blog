## ⚡ MiniMax M2.5: Efficiency Meets Power

Shanghai-based **MiniMax** has always prioritized efficiency, but the **M2.5** release (February 12, 2026) proves they haven't sacrificed capability for speed.

### Model Specifications

- **Total Parameters**: 230 billion
- **Active Parameters**: 10 billion (MoE architecture)
- **Context Window**: 197K tokens
- **Max Output**: 131K tokens
- **Pricing**: $0.29 per million input tokens

MiniMax M2.5 is officially positioned as "the world's most efficient coding model," but that's underselling it. Through extensive reinforcement learning training on hundreds of thousands of complex scenarios, M2.5 achieves:

- **95% accuracy** on coding benchmarks
- **2x faster** inference than comparable models
- **Tool-first design** for seamless integration
- **Multi-file editing** with context awareness

### The Agentic Advantage

What sets M2.5 apart is its focus on "agentic workflows." Unlike models that simply generate code, M2.5 understands software engineering as a process. It can:

- Navigate complex codebases
- Execute shell commands
- Manage multi-step deployment pipelines
- Debug existing code with contextual understanding

For startups and developers watching their API budgets, M2.5 offers GPT-5-level performance at a fraction of the cost.
